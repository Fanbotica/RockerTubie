DBH-1 Motor Driver Library
Written and debugged by David Williams (Thevolget). 
All rights reserved.

This library is designed to be used with the DBH-1 Series of motor drivers that 
can be found on EBay or Aliexpress (usually under the name of 'wingxine').  

This library will assume the following pins are used by default:

	ENA - Pin 2
	ENB - Pin 4
	IN1A - Pin 3 (Input for motor A - needs to be PWM pin)
	IN1B - Pin 5 (Input for motor B - needs to be PWM pin)
	IN2A - Pin 6 (Input for motor A - needs to be PWM pin)
	IN2B - Pin 9 (Input for motor B - needs to be PWM pin)
	CTA - Analog Pin 0 (Optional)
	CTB - Analog Pin 1 (Optional)
	
	Pins CTA and CTB are pins for reporting the current draw of the driver back to 
	the microcontroller.  The driver outputs a analog value based on current draw.
	
	EN1 and EN2 are pins for enabling the driver's output to the respective motor.
	
	IN1A and IN2A (as well as IN2A and IN2B) are the inputs for motor A (and B 
	respectively).  When IN1A is driven LOW and IN2A is	provided a PWM signal, the 
	motor will go in reverse.  When IN1A is provided a PWM signal and IN2A is driven 
	LOW, the motor will go forward.

	The driver requires a maximum duty cycle on the PWM input of no more than 98%.  
	Any higher might damage the driver / result in instability.
	
Library usage:

	Option 1:
		DBH1.init();	This will use the default pins
	
	Option 2:
		DBH1.init(IN1A, IN1B, IN2A, IN2B, ENA, ENB, CTA, CTB);	  This will define which
			pins are used on the microcontroller.  
	
	Once defined the motor can be controlled by using:
		DBH1.Forward(Motor A PWM value, Motor B PWM value);		Moves both motors forward
		DBH1.Reverse(Motor A PWM value, Motor B PWM value);		Moves both motors reverse
		DBH1.Braking();											UNTESTED - USE WITH CAUTION
		DBH1.Coasting();										Disables motor output
		DBH1.ForwardA(PWM value);								Moves Motor A or B at X% speed
		DBH1.ReverseA(PWM value);								Forward or Reverse
		DBH1.ForwardB(PWM value);
		DBH1.ReverseB(PWM value);
		DBH1.DisableA();
		DBH1.DisableB();
		DBH1.BrakeA();											UNTESTED - USE WITH CAUTION
		DBH1.BrakeB();											UNTESTED - USE WITH CAUTION
